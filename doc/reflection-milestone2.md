## Dashboard Implementation and Reflection


## Tab 1: Malnutrition 
### Implemented Features:
1. The dashboard displays the spatial distribution of seven malnutrition indicators using Plotly/choropleth map.
2. Temporal distribution of fatality count and poverty indicator for selected nations using the Altair package.
3. Comparative analysis between countries.
4. Detailed tooltips for data points on the maps and charts.

### Not Yet Implemented:
1. Improve the css to the layout

### Reflection:
The dashboard effectively presents spatial and temporal trends in malnutrition indicators. However, the lack of interactivity limits user exploration. Future improvements could include interactive filtering, comparative analysis tools, and detailed tooltips for a better understanding of data points.
