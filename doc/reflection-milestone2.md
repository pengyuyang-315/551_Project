## Dashboard Implementation and Reflection


## Tab 1: Malnutrition 
### Implemented Features:
1. The dashboard displays the spatial distribution of seven malnutrition indicators using Plotly/choropleth map.
2. Temporal distribution of fatality count and poverty indicator for selected nations using the Altair package.
3. Comparative analysis between countries.
4. Detailed tooltips for data points on the maps and charts.

### Not Yet Implemented:
1. Improve the css to the layout

### Reflection:
The dashboard effectively presents spatial and temporal trends in malnutrition indicators. However, the lack of interactivity limits user exploration. Future improvements could include interactive filtering, comparative analysis tools, and detailed tooltips for a better understanding of data points.

## Tab 2: World Poverty
### Implemented Features:
1. The world map displays 6 key indicators of poverty by country.
2. Drop-down menu for users to select country and region with in that country to compare key poverty indicators in a general/regional perspective.
3. Altair visualization of the key indicators in comparison with general/regional perspective.
4. Bar plot comparison of hovered world-map selected country and drop-down menu selected country.

### Not Yet Implemented:
1. Improve the css to the layout.
2. Rearrange the graphs and charts to make it more readable.

### Reflection:
The dashboard does a good job in showing the key indicators of world poverty categorized by countries. The comparisons between countries and with in countries can give people a understanding of how each country performs in terms of minimizing poverty, and whether the development across regions within a country is balanced. However, due to the complexity of the indicators, users may not have a deep understanding of how the indicators speak for poverty. Future improvements could include providing the users with world mean, median, variance of each key indicators we used to measure world poverty.
