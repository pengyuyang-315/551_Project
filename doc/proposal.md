# üåçProposal for The Project: Illuminating the Nexus of Poverty and Child Malnutrition 


## Motivation and Purpose

### üåüOur Role:
As students deeply invested in understanding and tackling global social issues, we are driven by a passion for making a meaningful impact. Our role in this project is to embark on a journey of exploration and analysis, delving into the complexities of poverty and child malnutrition to unearth insights that can drive positive change.

### üéØTarget Audience:
Our envisioned audience comprises a diverse array of stakeholders, ranging from policymakers and researchers to grassroots organizations and concerned citizens. By developing a data visualization dashboard, we aim to create a powerful tool that resonates with anyone committed to addressing the root causes of poverty and improving child well-being.

### üåçProblem Statement:
Child malnutrition stands as a stark manifestation of systemic poverty, perpetuating a vicious cycle of deprivation and vulnerability. Despite decades of concerted efforts, millions of children worldwide continue to suffer from malnutrition, facing lifelong consequences that ripple through generations. Traditional approaches to poverty alleviation often fall short of addressing the multifaceted nature of this challenge, necessitating a paradigm shift towards more holistic, data-driven solutions.

### üöÄPurpose of Dashboard:
At the heart of our endeavor lies a singular purpose: to illuminate the intricate connections between poverty and child malnutrition through the lens of data visualization. By distilling complex datasets into intuitive visualizations, our dashboard seeks to empower users with actionable insights that can inform policy decisions, drive resource allocation, and inspire grassroots initiatives. Ultimately, our aim is to catalyze a collective effort towards building a future where every child has access to nutritious food, quality healthcare, and opportunities for a brighter tomorrow.

## Description of the Data

### Dataset 1: Malnutrition Across the Globe
#### Context:
Our dataset offers a comprehensive overview of child malnutrition, encompassing key indicators such as severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight among children aged 0‚Äì59 months.

#### Variables:
- Severe Wasting (%)
- Wasting ‚Äì Moderate and Severe (%)
- Overweight ‚Äì Moderate and Severe (%)
- Stunting ‚Äì Moderate and Severe (%)
- Underweight ‚Äì Moderate and Severe (%)

### Dataset 2: Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
#### Context:
Drawing upon the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) dataset developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), we gain insights into the multidimensional aspects of poverty.

#### Variables:
- Adjusted Headcount Ratio (MPI)
- Incidence of Poverty (Headcount Ratio)
- Intensity of Poverty

### Additional Data:
- OPHI's working paper series and research briefings
- Global MPI covering more than 100 developing countries
- Video guides on using the Alkire Foster (AF) method

## Research Questions

1. What are the primary drivers of child malnutrition across different socio-economic contexts?
2. How do poverty levels correlate with various forms of child malnutrition globally?
3. Are there specific demographic factors that exacerbate the risk of child malnutrition within impoverished communities?
4. What interventions have proven successful in reducing child malnutrition rates in low-income regions?
5. How can policymakers leverage data-driven insights to design targeted strategies for poverty alleviation and child nutrition improvement?

By delving into these research questions, we aspire to deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics at play and pave the way for innovative solutions that address the root causes of poverty and child malnutrition. Through collaborative efforts and a commitment to evidence-based decision-making, we envision a future where every child thrives, regardless of their socio-economic background.
