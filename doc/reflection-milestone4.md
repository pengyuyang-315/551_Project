## Reflection
### Has it been easy to use your app?
For this version of the dashboard, navigating through it is quite straightforward. We've structured the interface into three tabs, each focusing on different subtopics. The "Overview" tab provides a quick overview of our main topic, presenting general information and graphs related to the subtopics. The other two tabs, "Malnutrition" and "Poverty", visualize critical malnutrition indicators and poverty data respectively. Utilizing Plotly/choropleth maps, we display spatial distributions of malnutrition indicators, while the Altair package helps showcase temporal trends in fatality counts and poverty indicators for selected nations. Additionally, to enhance user experience, we've included specific titles for each plot and incorporated interactive features, making it easier for users to access desired information and comprehend the data more effectively. Overall, we believe this layout enhances usability and facilitates exploration of the dashboard's content.
