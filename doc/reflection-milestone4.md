## Reflection
### Has it been easy to use your app?
For this version of the dashboard, navigating through it is quite straightforward. We've structured the interface into three tabs, each focusing on different subtopics. The "Overview" tab provides a quick overview of our main topic, presenting general information and graphs related to the subtopics. The other two tabs, "Malnutrition" and "Poverty", visualize critical malnutrition indicators and poverty data respectively. Utilizing Plotly/choropleth maps, we display spatial distributions of malnutrition indicators, while the Altair package helps showcase temporal trends in fatality counts and poverty indicators for selected nations. Additionally, to enhance user experience, we've included specific titles for each plot and incorporated interactive features, making it easier for users to access desired information and comprehend the data more effectively. Overall, we believe this layout enhances usability and facilitates exploration of the dashboard's content.

### Are there reccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?
Reccurring themes on what is good: 
Loading speed: The tabs we designed has fast loading speed and almost no loading errors.
Readability Advantage: Our methods of reporting the relationships between data, including bar plots, line graphs, donut charts, world maps, can well present data and has good readability.

Reccurring themes on what can be improved:
Usage frequency: Althrough the dashboard is a valuable tool for many users, serving their needs in accessing malnutrition and poverty data, it is reported to be used only occasionally by the user.
Feature Requests and Customization: 
Incorporating desired additional features, such as user-selected visualization tools, would make the dashboard more versatile and aligned with user needs.
