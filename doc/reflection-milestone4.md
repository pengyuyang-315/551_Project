## Reflection
### Has it been easy to use your app?
For this version of the dashboard, navigating through it is quite straightforward. We've structured the interface into three tabs, each focusing on different subtopics. The "Overview" tab provides a quick overview of our main topic, presenting general information and graphs related to the subtopics. The other two tabs, "Malnutrition" and "Poverty", visualize critical malnutrition indicators and poverty data respectively. Utilizing Plotly/choropleth maps, we display spatial distributions of malnutrition indicators, while the Altair package helps showcase temporal trends in fatality counts and poverty indicators for selected nations. Additionally, to enhance user experience, we've included specific titles for each plot and incorporated interactive features, making it easier for users to access desired information and comprehend the data more effectively. Overall, we believe this layout enhances usability and facilitates exploration of the dashboard's content.

### Are there reccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?
Reccurring themes on what is good: 
Loading speed: The tabs we designed has fast loading speed and almost no loading errors.
Readability Advantage: Our methods of reporting the relationships between data, including bar plots, line graphs, donut charts, world maps, can well present data and has good readability.

Reccurring themes on what can be improved:
Usage frequency: Althrough the dashboard is a valuable tool for many users, serving their needs in accessing malnutrition and poverty data, it is reported to be used only occasionally by the user.
Feature Requests and Customization: 
Incorporating desired additional features, such as user-selected visualization tools, would make the dashboard more versatile and aligned with user needs.

### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?
- The choice of the website's background color should be harmonious with the overall theme, fostering a cohesive visual experience. This attention to detail supports a polished and unified presentation that resonates with the intended audience.
- The design of the charts should prioritize clarity and interpretability. It's crucial that these visual representations convey information in an intuitive manner, enabling users to quickly grasp complex data insights without confusion.
- Performance optimization is critical. Dashboards should load quickly and operate smoothly, as performance impacts user satisfaction directly. Efficient data handling and optimization of visual elements are important to maintain fast response times.
- The overview should distill complex data into understandable summaries.
- Allow users to interact with the data, such as filtering views or selecting specific metrics to focus on. This interaction should not be overwhelming but offer enough flexibility for the user to customize their view.
